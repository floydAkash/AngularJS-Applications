# AngularJS-Applications

This application pulls content from Lichess HTTP API. Documentation can be found <a href="https://github.com/ornicar/lila"> here </a>. AngularJS ngResource is used to wrap around AJAX functionality to get the data from Lichess and display information about a given username entered.

Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/ornicar/">Thibault Duplessis a.k.a ornicar</a> for work on Lichess and to other contributors as well.
